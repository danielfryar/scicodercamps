      <h1>Why I Decided To Learn Programming</h1>
      <p>At a young age I was always intrigued by learning how things ticked. I loved taking my bike apart and try to put it back together. Sometimes I was unsuccesful but it was all about the joy of learning. After the first online course I took for coding, I fell in love! I wanted to learn more and I'm excited to continue learning as the years go by.</p>
