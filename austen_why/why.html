      <h2>Why do I want to become a programmer</h2>
        <p>My name is Austen Lopez. I am 25 years old. I started diving into
           programming about a year ago and fell in love. I have done many jobs
           throughout my life that were just to pay the bills. I have always
           sensed a urge to be creative in my life and feel that programming
           is a great way to express that creativity. I don't want to work every
           day at a dead end job feeling no purpose or drive to acellerate my
           traits. The abilities and skills I have aquired thus far have made me
           acknowledge the fact that I AM a programmer!</p><hr>
      <h2>How I am becomming a programmer</h2>
        <p>I am currently enrolled at Southern Careers Insitute in the FullStack
           Javascript program. I attend my classes with an open mind and with
           patients knowing I will be fighting the battle of learning a new
           language.</p><hr>
      <h2>What do I do</h2>
          <p>I usitlize my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a well
           running, fast, and user friendly website. These programs allow me to,
           quickly, develop websites and programs from my sheer creativity or I
           can take information, for instance, from a client or customer and
           build it to their satisfaction.</p>
